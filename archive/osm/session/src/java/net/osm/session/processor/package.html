The <code>net.osm.session.processor</code> package provides support for a 
simple processor model.  The <code>SimpleProcessor</code> interface defined 
within this package enables access to the operations required to manage an 
abstract resource acting in the role of a processor. As a 
<code>AbstractProcessor</code> a <code>SimpleProcessor</code> reference can 
handle general request related to process exeuction such as start, suspend, 
stop, etc. together with operations supporting access to the processor 
description and process state.

<h4>Development Notes</h4>

The current implementation has been prepared as a proof-of-concept.  Planned revisions include
the introduction of a PSS storage sub-system for artifacts, generation of manifests, and the 
introduction of specific description types supporting directy federation across UDDI, JNDI and 
COsNaming services.  Planned enhancements include the creation of a series of demonstrations 
depicting service discovery by client C1 from a provider P1, service referral by C1 to another 
client C2, service invocation by C2 against a service provider P0, and presentation of the 
complete service referral chain.

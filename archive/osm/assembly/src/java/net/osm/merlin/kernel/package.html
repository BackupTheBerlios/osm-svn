The kernel package defines a top level {@link net.osm.merlin.kernel.Kernel} that serves as a host to a root {@link net.osm.merlin.kernel.Container} that provides support for container hierachy creation. The default kernel implementation handles the setup of the logging infrastructure, extension manager, and the root container.

<h3>Funtional Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Geneneric container architecture.
<li>Hierachical container composition.
</ul>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<p>A primary objective of this container is to provide simple composition of applications and the management of service provission from parent to child containers with minimal administration overhead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Component-based architecture.
<li>Deployment as a stand-alone application or as an embedeed component.
<li>Fully configurable classpaths at the kernel and container levels.
<li>Support for cascading startup and shutdown.
<li>Protected classloader hierachy.
<li>Graceful management of interupts.
<li>Integral logging.
</ul>

<h3>Object Model</h3>
<p>An container is primarily a component type manager. Actual type management is handled by an embedded {@link net.osm.merlin.registry.Registry} and the associated default implementation {@link net.osm.merlin.registry.DefaultRegistry}.  In addition to component type support, the container provides a framework from the creation of container hierachies.  Services established in a parent container are available as potential candidate suppliers to component providers in sibling containers.

A geneneric component type management service supporting automated component assembly, service deployment and service decommissioning . The service acts as a repository for component types and profiles.  The repository enables resolution of component types based on a classloader, extension directory set defintion (managemed by the host kernel), a supplied classpath, and component deployment directives.  Components are established based on the publication of components across a set jar file manifest together with explicit component profile directives included within the registry configuration. Given a manifest declaration of a component implementation class, a component type definition will be resolvable providing the registry can resolve all type constraints (specifically the validation of the dependecies of candidate supplier components).

<h3>Funtional Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Portable component type mangement.
<li>Automated service assembly.
</ul>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<p>A primary objective of this service is to provide simple deployment of components with minimal administration overhead.  In many cases, no component assembly directives are required as the container will apply assembly logic based on the meta-information association with component types that are either explicity declared, or implicly located via a classpath and extension directories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic component profile generation.
<li>Automatic assembly of components based on dependency and service production declarations.
<li>Service provider selection plug-in architecture.
<li>Customization of application content.
</ul>

<h3>Object Model</h3>
<p>The registry object model provides a simplified view of the <code>containerkit</code> framework.  The principal entry point is the {@link net.osm.merlin.registry.Registry} and the associated default  implementation {@link net.osm.merlin.registry.DefaultRegistry}.  The registry acts as a component type repository.  Component types are exposed as instances of the {@link net.osm.merlin.registry.ComponentType} interface.  Each component type represents a concrete component implementation class.  For each component type, the container associates at least one instantiation {@link net.osm.merlin.registry.Profile}.  A profile is either a default profile generated by the registry based on meta-information derived from the type, or, an explicit profile declared by the component assembler via the registry configuration.  Multiple profiles for a particular component type can coexist in the same registry.

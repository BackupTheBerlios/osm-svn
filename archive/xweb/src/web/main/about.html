<h2>model-driven collaboration</h2>
<p class="entry" style="padding:12">
Policy and rules of execution and separated from the runtime-framework enabling dynamic <strong>creation, deployment and modification</strong> of domain processes.  Policy and execution constraints governing business roles, privacy and disclosure policy, community membership, establishment and validity of collaborative encounters, and roles-based collaborative interaction constraints can be modelled independently of the run-time framework and dynamically activated when ready.  Policy models can be used to establish new business process ranging from contractual <strong>fulfillment</strong>, bilateral <strong>negotiation</strong>, classic processes relating to <strong>supply chain </strong> management, or advanced collaborative business processes such as <strong>actioning</strong>, formal <strong>voting</strong> and collective decision making processes.  By combining new and existing models, customers can construction new business processes and on-line digital products more rapidly.  Business process available from partner organisations (such as logistics or financial services) can be plugged into domain processes automating the interconnection and federation of process execution across partner organisations.  In turn, new domain processes can be published towards partners or external market facilitating the establishment of new supply and distribution channels.</p>

<h2>peer-to-peer</h2>
<p class="entry" style="padding:12">
OSM's platform architecture has been crafted from the ground up to function as a full peer in an open market environment. Underlying the OSM application and service layers is a distributed computing platform and object model dedicated to supporting the establishment and maintenance of cross-enterprise dependencies (including bi-directional resource consumption, production, resource referral, administration and access control).</p>

<h2>standards based</h2>
<p class="entry" style="padding:12">
The OSM model based architecture is conformant with the Object Management Group's <strong>Community</strong> and <strong>Collaboration Framework</strong> specifications. XML based representation of models is based on  <strong>DPML</strong> - the Digital Product Modelling Language. The platform incorporates the OMG <strong>Task and Session</strong> specification of people, places and things - delivering a strong user-centred business model that encapsulates standard services for life-cycle, collections, transactions, properties, time and security.</p>

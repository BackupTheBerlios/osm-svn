<p>The <code>org.omg.PKIAuthority</code> package provides 14 interfaces for interacting with PKI authorities through the
management of certificates. The major interfaces are CertificateAuthority, RegistrationAuthority, and CertificateStatusResponder. 
The rest are employed to maintain the interactive and asynchronous behavior that is typical using a PKI.

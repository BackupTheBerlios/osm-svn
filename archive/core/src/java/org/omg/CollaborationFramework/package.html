<p>The <code>org.omg.CollaborationFramework</code> package defines a framework for the execution of business processes between organizations, and the integration of process event into the internal information infrastructure within an enterprise. The CollaborationFramework defines the interfaces to a Processor, used as the base for collaborative, shared and auditable process execution across business communities.  Generic services are provided for multilateral voting, contractual engagement and customized process execution.  The CollaborationFramework represents the runtime engine for DPML process descriptions (such as negotiation, auctioning, contractual fulfillment, multilateral voting procedurtes) and provides factory services for general DMPL based criteria covering the creation of busienss community, legal agencies, and generic process.
<p>Principal interfaces defined under this specification include:
<ul>
<li>EngagementProcessor, a processor supporting the registration of Evidence and generation of Proof by a membership
<li>VoteProcessor, a processor supporting the registration of votes by a membership
<li>CollaborationProcessor, a processor supporting collaborative interaction between members of an Encounter.
</ul>
<p>These interfaces build upon the specifications established under the CommunityFramework, in particular the notion of Membership is reused as the basis for the definition of a shared Task associated to a common Processor.  The CollaborationFramework continues the Model/Simulator pattern established under the CommunityFramework specifications as the mechanisms for separation of configuration and execution policy from the IDL computational interface.<p>

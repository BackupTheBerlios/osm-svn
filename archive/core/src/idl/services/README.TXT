This folder contains the complete set of IDL for services and applications.
The pss folder contains an edited version of the CosCollection IDL.  Changes 
to the CosCollection.idl include the replacement of the keyword "key" that 
conflicts with the PSDL compiler when compiling IDL that includes 
CosCollection.idl.  Build files must explicity select between
normal/CosCollection.idl as opposed to pss/CosCollection.

            <td>
              A walk through of setting up an index, creating a couple of 
              projects, adding some content, executing a build, followed by
              a review of the process and the generated project resources.

              Addition of a testcase to our 'system' project and demonstration 
              of the automatic compilation and test execution provided by Magic.

            <td><a href="filtering.html">Build Customization</a></td>
            <td>
              A simple example of build customization using an explicit build.xml
              file.  The example demonstrates the usage of classic Ant filters and 
              the Depot filter task within an extended init phase.

              This tutorial takes us through the process of module creation and 
              and includes an summary of the generated module and it's potential
              application when publishing content.

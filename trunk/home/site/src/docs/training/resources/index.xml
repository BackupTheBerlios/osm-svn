      <p>
      A common requirement across a broad-spectrum of software projects is 
      the management of resources such as configuration data, property files, 
      meta information, classpath descriptions, etc.  These resources can form
      a central part of well-functioning application and are frequently handled
      as identifiable and versioned artifacts.
      This tutorial will take you through the usage of a product named Transit that
      handles retrieval of versioned resources using the standard Java URL protocol 
      handler.

      The Metro container extwnds the generic part plugin instantiation 
      model with support for constructor parameter types supporting logging 
      channel assignment, provison of context data, and initialization of 
      intermal parts.

            component instance (i.e. destruction of the component implies 
            destruction of all internal parts).

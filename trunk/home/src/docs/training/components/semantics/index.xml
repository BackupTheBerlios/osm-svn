      <p>
      A number of factors related to a component implementation class 
      impact the way in which instance of that class should be handled.
      These factors include:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
        the component <a href="lifestyle.html"> lifestyle policy</a> - encapsulating 
        the capability (or inability) of the implementation class to handle multiple 
        concurrent threads of activity
        </li>
        <li>the component <a href="lifestyle.html">lifecycle policy</a>  - capturing the 
        sequencing of activities that an instance assumes during commissioning, general 
        execution, and decommissioning (typically represented by operations
        such as start, suspend, resume, stop, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>the component <a href="collection.html">garbage collection policy</a>  - 
        reflecting Weak, soft, and hard references maintained by a runtime controller 
        on a given component instance
        </li>
      </ul>
